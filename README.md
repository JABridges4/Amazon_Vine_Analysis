# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to pull product review data regarding mobile apps from Amazon in order to analyze the Vine review program. This analysis looked at reviews that were found to be helpful (50% or more) and at least 20 total votes in order to make sure we were getting accurate information. We then compared reviews from both paid and unpaid vines.
## Results
.The unpaid vines are far more popular, in fact there were no helpful paid vines with at least 20 total votes in the entire data set
. Vine reviews were very positive, nearly 46% of all reviews were 5 star reviews.
## Summary
It is clear that Amazon users prefer using unpaid vines to review products, but those who do tend to leave positive reviews of the app that they are reviewing. We would have to refine our search parameters or get a new data set to run analyais for paid vines.
